# Short Story Blog

The main perpuse of this website is to use Flask API. The users can create, update or remove posts from database also accessing a user by his username or a post by using its id. The wbsite is using a complete login and register system and if the user forget his password can request to reset his password. I used sqlite database to test and run the application locally and then postgress database to run it in production. The website is hosted on heroku.To have a look on it please use the below link:
